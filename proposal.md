# Hackbright Final Project


## Overview
___ allows users to search for housing based on proximity to a given location and commute time.

### Feature List
- Allow user to enter a key point of interest & select how far they're willing to commute
- Scrape Craigslist for housing posts
- Calculate distance between Craigslist posts & key point of interest
- Display results:
  - As text with calculated distance
  - As points on a map
- When user clicks on a result, compute commute time:
  - By driving
  - By public transportation


### User Stories

### Research
Technologies needed:
- Craigslist data
- Library for calculating distance given latitude and longitude
